### Installation 
---

Make sure you have the packages installed on your system:
- fastfetch
- a nerd font for the icons display (https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts). I recommend ```ttf-fantasque-nerd```.

Then, clone this repository by running

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Gaming-Linux-FR/GLFfetch ~/.config/fastfetch/GLFfetch
```

### Launch GLFfetch
---

Execute in terminal

```bash
fastfetch --config ~/.config/fastfetch/GLFfetch/challenge.jsonc
```

Create an alias in your terminal. IE if you are using fish, add in your ```~/.config/fish/config.fish```

```bash
alias GLFfetch="fastfetch --config ~/.config/fastfetch/GLFfetch/challenge.jsonc"
```

TODO
---

There is a lot to be done.

Some ideas I would like to do in the future:
- ~~find an easy way to get access to the icons in terminal on all distros (I had to remove the icons until we find an easy solution)~~
- ~~move to Fastfetch because why not~~ (Thanks to @Sparkway)
- improve output colors / display with GLF brand colors
- add a if in the print info when 30 days goal reached
- add progress bar

### Installation

Make sure you have neofetch installed on your distro. Then, use the tutorial below.

<details>
<summary> GUI </summary>

- Go to the `.config` directory in your home folder using your file manager.\
*Note: Press `Ctrl + H` to locate it, as it is a hidden directory.*
- Navigate into the `neofetch` directory.

- Open the file `config.conf` with your preferred text editor and replace the text inside it with the config from this repo. Save the file and you're done!

TODO

There is a lot to be done.

Some ideas I would like to do in the future:
- move to Fastfetch because why not
- improve output colors / display with GLF brand colors
- add a if in the print info when 30 days goal reached
- add progress bar

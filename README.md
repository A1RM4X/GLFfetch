TODO
---

There is a lot to be done.

Some ideas I would like to do in the future:
- find an easy way to get access to the icons in terminal on all distros (I had to remove the icons until we find an easy solution)
- move to Fastfetch because why not
- improve output colors / display with GLF brand colors
- add a if in the print info when 30 days goal reached
- add progress bar
